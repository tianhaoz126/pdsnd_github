## Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

## Description
In this project, we use Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington.  
The goal is to practice working with Git and GitHub by making multiple branches, commits, and merges while maintaining good documentation.  

You will write Python code to import the data and answer interesting questions by computing descriptive statistics.  
You will also add documentation and refactor the code to practice realistic version control workflows.

## Files used
- `bikeshare.py` → the main Python script (provided by Udacity, refactored by us).  
- `new_york_city.csv` (local only, ignored by `.gitignore`).  
- `.gitignore` → ensures large dataset files like `.csv` are not pushed to GitHub.  

## Dataset
The dataset contains randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities.  
Each of the data files shares the same six (6) columns:  

1. Start Time  
2. End Time  
3. Trip Duration  
4. Start Station  
5. End Station  
6. User Type  

## How to run
```bash
python3 bikeshare.py
